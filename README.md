## Data Engineering Projects

## Level's of Skill for each Project

**Blue** :

* All code follows best practices and was run through a linter   

* Classes and Functions are used when appropriate  

* Project is organized into modules logically  

* project is a pypi project  

**Purple**:  


* code is testable without interacting with external dependencies

* code is tests with reasonable code coverage.

* code has intergration tests for external dependencies. 

* project uses has tests for all the infrastructure  

 
**Brown** :

* project uses infrastructure as code (terraform or Cloudwatch)  

* project uses Docker

* code uses fakes (mocks and stubs)

* code relies on abstraction's (interfaces).

* project uses a CI/CD process using something like Jenkins  

* project uses concurrency when appropriate
